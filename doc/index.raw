== Overview ==

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===

* Boost 1.58
* OpenMPI
* cmake

=== Building ===

The program does not attempt to install to any system directories. Rather its binaries into its own `./bin` folder. In order to compile the software, type

```bash
./install.sh
```

If prerequisites are not installed in a default directory (e.g. there are errors relating to Boost) then you can tell the installer to find `include` and `lib` directories at another location by passing a command line argument to `install.sh`. For example, suppose that Boost is installed in 
```bash
/home/sharker/work/include
/home/sharker/work/lib
```

Then the installation could succeed with

```bash
./install.sh /home/sharker/work
```

=== PersistenceTuples ===
==== Subsample ====

subsample will accept four command line arguments:
```bash
/path/to/sample.json delta p /path/to/subsample.json
```
where `sample.json` is a file containing paths to persistence diagrams
```json
{"path":"/base/folder","sample":[["...","...","..."],["...","...","..."],["...","...","..."],...]}
```
and `delta` is the subsampling parameter (we want to achieve a delta-sparse, delta-dense subsample).
The sample.json file may contain additional fields which can be ignored.

The output of the subsample program will be stored in the supplied filename `/path/to/subsample.json` and will be of the following form:
```json
{"sample":"/path/to/sample.json","delta":delta, "p": p, "subsample":[...]}
```

==== Distance ====

The input to the distance program is the output from the subsample program. The arguments are
```bash
error /path/to/subsample.json /path/to/distance.txt /path/to/distance_filter.txt
```
where the first is a nonnegative number giving the relative error for computing the approximate distance between the persistence diagrams (supply 0.0 for exact distance computation), the second a path to the subsample (which contains a path to the original sample), the third path is the location the distance matrix is to be stored, and the fourth is an optional path to a filter for the distance matrix computations. If supplied, this distance matrix filter should be a sequence in {0,1} that is the same size as the expected output of /path/to/distance.txt. If not supplied, all pairwise distances will be computed.
